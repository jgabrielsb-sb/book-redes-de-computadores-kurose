R6: Suppose that you want to make a transaction to a server by the fast way possible. Would you use TCP or UDP? Why? 

If I want to make a transaction thinking only about how fast it will be delivered without caring about delivery guarantee and security, I would choose UDP instead of TCP. That's because UDP is a light weight and faster transport protocol, cause it does not send much extra header information and is not connection oriented.
