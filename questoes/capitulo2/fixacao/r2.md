R2: Qual a diferença entre arquitetura de rede e arquitetura de aplicação?

the application layer is the final layer of the hierarchy of the layers of the internet. It is the layer that the programmer must implement. The application layer is responsible for defining the semantic, structure and the rules of the messages that must be sent. On the other side, the transport layer is the second layer (from top to bottom) on the hierarchy. It is a layer that is implemented by the OS, but the programmer has the choice of choosing the one that will be used (usually TCP -> Transmission Control Protocol or UDP -> Datagram User Protocol). It is responsible for sending the message end-to-end and defines some aspects like delivery guarantee, confiability and security (on some cases, like TLS that implements cryptography).
