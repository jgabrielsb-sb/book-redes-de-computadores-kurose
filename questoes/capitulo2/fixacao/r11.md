Enunciado: Por que HTTP, SMTP e IMAP rodam sobre TCP e não UDP?

HTTP, SMTP and IMAP run behalf TCP because there must a guarantee that the messages are being delivered. For example: imagine that I send an important message to my boss. On this case, I must be 100% certain that the message has been delivered to him. In case that it hasn´t, I must at least know that so as I can come to a proper action. Additionally, the applications that use HTTP, SMTP and IMAP are not time sensitive. The certainty of delivering is more important than delivering it fast.
Another important aspect is that those are applications that must be delivered in order to guarantee a proper user experience. Following the same example that I have earlier, I want an email to be delivered exactly as I wrote it.
