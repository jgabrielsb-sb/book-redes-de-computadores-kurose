R3: Para uma sessão de comunicação entre um par de processos, qual processo é o cliente e qual é o servidor?

The client is the one that requests a service while the server is the one that deliveries the service. On client-server based connection, all the clients requests are sent to a centralized server. On P2P (peer to peer based connection), a pair of clients communicates between each other directly. On both cases, the client is the one that requests a service and is the one that initiates the communication process.
